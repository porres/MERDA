#X text 77 261 This is a collection of Pure Data Abstractions that are inspired by Eurorack Modules. They need the ELSE library for Pure Data. ELSE is by Porres. MERDA is also by Porres., f 58;
#X text 77 313 Eventually \, MERDA will be incorporated into ELSE. This is still a very early draft., f 58;
#X text 76 368 The absctractions have savestating and you can also use [presets.m] to save different presets., f 58;
#X text 154 420 This first alpha release needs ELSE 1.0-0 rc101 and Pd 0.54-1 to run., f 35;

#X text 582 145 M.E.R.D.A. Modules allow you to set values via knobs and other controls like number boxes and buttons. They all have a state saving mechanism \, which means it loads the values from the last time it was saved in a patch., f 56;
#X text 582 424 More details in the help files of each modules., f 56;
#X text 582 211 Note that M.E.R.D.A also has a preset management module.;
#X text 582 241 This is still exerimental and some modules aren't really ready \, don't have CV input and still work linda like pedals., f 56;
#X text 582 295 Some moludes have CV Input and some of these have attenuverters \, which are knob controls that control the amount of CV \, so it attenuates with values from 0 to 100 \, but it also inverts the signal and attenuates it (by using values from 0 to -100). Usually these CV parameters are also controlled by GUIs like knobs and or number boxes \, so the CV values are actually ADDED to the set value., f 56;
